# addsol_nl_custom project memory

## Scope and architecture

Frappe v15 app for N L Electromech. Plate handling is opt-in and is implemented
under `addsol_nl_custom/plates/`, with DocTypes, reports, client scripts, and
patches in the app package. The single Plate Settings document holds company
wide plate controls; item and Item Group metadata describe plate dimensions and
defaults. Keep ordinary ERPNext purchasing unaffected when plate purchasing is
disabled.

The React Purchase Receipt UI is in the separate `erpnext-ui` repository. It
uses the whitelisted methods in `plates/api.py` to read whether the feature is
enabled, check whether an item is weight managed, and determine whether the
current user can decide a weight variance. Server-side validation remains the
source of truth.

## Weight and purchasing rules

- Weight formulas are limited to `L`, `W`, `T`, and `MF`; `custom_formula` is
  not a valid variable inside a weight formula.
- Per-kg pricing may be sourced from supplier/item defaults, but a Purchase
  Order line can carry an edited rate. Receipt logic must preserve the actual
  transaction's rate and weight data.
- Keep weight tolerance, over-billing allowance, approval roles, cutting
  operation, and offcut settings in Plate Settings unless the data is truly an
  item-specific property.
- API lookups that control UI behavior must not expose data to guests. The
  backend must still enforce item eligibility, permissions, tolerance, and
  approval decisions when documents are saved or submitted.

## Script Reports

`Plate Stock Register` and `Plate Receipt Weight Variance` have Python
implementations beside their report JSON. Their Report records must be standard
(`is_standard: "Yes"`) so Frappe imports the module's `execute()` function.
Otherwise Frappe treats them as custom script reports and tries to compile the
database `report_script`; an empty value raises `TypeError: Not allowed source
type: "NoneType"`.

The migration `mark_plate_reports_standard` updates existing Report records as
well as the JSON definitions. It is listed in `patches.txt`; after deployment,
run `bench migrate` for the target site.

## Migrations and validation

- Patch order is declared in `patches.txt`, split into `pre_model_sync` and
  `post_model_sync`. Keep patches idempotent and guard optional records.
- `ensure_plate_child_table_columns` must use APIs available in the installed
  Frappe v15 database adapter. `MariaDBDatabase.add_column` is not available;
  use supported schema helpers / column checks.
- Run `ruff check addsol_nl_custom` and relevant app tests from the bench when
  available. Validate changed JSON fixtures and inspect the generated migration
  effects before deployment.

## Recent report fix (2026-10-15)

The report traceback on `query-report/Plate Stock Register` came from both plate
Script Reports being marked non-standard while their Python `execute()` methods
lived only in app modules. Both report JSON files now mark them standard, and a
post-model-sync patch upgrades existing database records. The fix was pushed to
`main` in commits `19f6746` and `e0f0789`; the latter includes the plate API
capability response used by the React receipt UI.
